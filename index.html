            <header>Array</header>
            <p>Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations.
                Neither the
                length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed. Since an array's length can
                change at any time,
                and data can be stored at non-contiguous locations in the array, JavaScript arrays are not guaranteed
                to be dense; this
                depends on how the programmer chooses to use them. In general, these are convenient characteristics;
                but if these
                features are not desirable for your particular use, you might consider using typed arrays.</p>
            <p>Arrays cannot use strings as element indexes (as in an associative array) but must use integers. Setting
                or accessing
                via non-integers using bracket notation (or dot notation) will not set or retrieve an element from the
                array list
                itself, but will set or access a variable associated with that array's object property collection. The
                array's object
                properties and list of array elements are separate, and the array's traversal and mutation operations
                cannot be applied
                to these named properties.</p>
            <code>var fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana'];
            
            console.log(fruits.length);
            // 2</code>

        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="filter">Array.prototype.filter</header>
            <p>The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided
                function.</p>
            filter() calls a provided callback function once for each element in an array, and constructs a new array
            of all the
            values for which callback returns a value that coerces to true. callback is invoked only for indexes of the
            array which
            have assigned values; it is not invoked for indexes which have been deleted or which have never been
            assigned values.
            Array elements which do not pass the callback test are simply skipped, and are not included in the new
            array.
            <code>var words = ['spray', 'limit', 'elite', 'exuberant', 'destruction', 'present'];
                        
                        const result = words.filter(word => word.length > 6);
                        
                        console.log(result);
                        // expected output: Array ["exuberant", "destruction", "present"]</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="map">Array.prototype.map</header>
            <p>The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in
                the calling
                array.</p>
            <p>map calls a provided callback function once for each element in an array, in order, and constructs a new
                array from the
                results. callback is invoked only for indexes of the array which have assigned values, including
                undefined. It is not
                called for missing elements of the array (that is, indexes that have never been set, which have been
                deleted or which
                have never been assigned a value).</p>
            <code>var array1 = [1, 4, 9, 16];
            
            // pass a function to map
            const map1 = array1.map(x => x * 2);
            
            console.log(map1);
            // expected output: Array [2, 8, 18, 32]</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="reduce">Array.prototype.reduce</header>
            <p>The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each member of the array resulting
                in a single
                output value.</p>
            <p></p>
            <code>const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
            const reducer = (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue;
            
            // 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
            console.log(array1.reduce(reducer));
            // expected output: 10
            
            // 5 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
            console.log(array1.reduce(reducer, 5));
            // expected output: 15</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="push">Array.prototype.push</header>
            <p>The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the
                array.</p>
            <p>push is intentionally generic. This method can be used with call() or apply() on objects resembling
                arrays. The push
                method relies on a length property to determine where to start inserting the given values. If the
                length property
                cannot be converted into a number, the index used is 0. This includes the possibility of length being
                nonexistent, in
                which case length will also be created.</p>
            <code>var animals = ['pigs', 'goats', 'sheep'];
            
            console.log(animals.push('cows'));
            // expected output: 4
            
            console.log(animals);
            // expected output: Array ["pigs", "goats", "sheep", "cows"]
            
            animals.push('chickens');
            
            console.log(animals);
            // expected output: Array ["pigs", "goats", "sheep", "cows", "chickens"]</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="shift">Array.prototype.shift</header>
            <p>The shift() method removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element. This method
                changes the
                length of the array.</p>
            <p>The shift method removes the element at the zeroeth index and shifts the values at consecutive indexes
                down, then
                returns the removed value. If the length property is 0, undefined is returned.</p>
            <code>var array1 = [1, 2, 3];
            
            var firstElement = array1.shift();
            
            console.log(array1);
            // expected output: Array [2, 3]
            
            console.log(firstElement);
            // expected output: 1</code>
